# travelling-salesman

This is a solution to the famous traveling salesman problem. This solution examines all possible paths in lexicographical order and picks the best one.

The quora answer on lexicographical ordering is great and insightful: https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-an-algorithm-that-generates-permutations-using-lexicographic-ordering

I learnt about algorithms, graphs and implementation from Daniel Shiffman youtube videos : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bePNiZLnglXUp2LXIjlCdb
